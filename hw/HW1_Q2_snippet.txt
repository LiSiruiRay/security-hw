2.  Hash  functions  and  privacy :  Bob  is  launching  a  new  secure  messaging  app,  BobCrypt.  When  
Alice
 
installs
 
the
 
app,
 
it
 
uploads
 
a
 
hash
 
of
 
her
 
phone
 
number
 
to
 
the
 
BobCrypt
 
server.
 
The
 
app
 
then
 
queries
 
the
 
server
 
by
 
sending
 
the
 
hash
 
of
 
each
 
phone
 
number
 
in
 
Alice’s
 
address
 
book
 
to
 
learn
 
which
 
of
 
Alice’s
 
friends
 
already
 
have
 
BobCrypt
 
accounts.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
that
 
users
 
can
 
discover
 
their
 
friends’
 
accounts
 
while
 
preventing
 
the
 
server
 
from
 
learning
 
every
 
user’s
 
address
 
book.
 
Bob  argues  that  the  server  only  sees  the  hashes  of  users’  contacts’  phone  numbers,  and  since  
hash-functions
 
are
 
one-way,
 
this
 
doesn’t
 
reveal
 
any
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
actual
 
phone
 
numbers.
 
Explain
 
to
 
Bob
 
why
 
he’s
 
wrong
 
by
 
describing
 
how
 
a
 
malicious
 
server
 
could
 
in
 
fact
 
learn
 
users’
 
contacts’
 
phone
 
numbers.
